## Notes
We noticed that in this fast-paced technology age more teenagers are relying on driving, instead of more eco-friendly ways to commute such as biking or walking. Driving has become the mainstream form of transportation and we planned to create a sleek website to avoid this. People are unaware of what carbon footprints are and how they can make simple differences. We showed them what they would gain through walking and biking, as well as recommendations for specific routes they take daily.
